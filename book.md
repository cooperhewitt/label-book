The posters are digitally printed on demand and sold to fans and collectors worldwide.</p><br><img src="https://images.collection.cooperhewitt.org/107567_949027a51d5e0aa2_n.jpg"><br><h1>Postcard, Spartakiada, Moscow 1928, 1928</h1><br><h2>1928</h2><br><ul><li>Letterpress</li><br><li>Collection of Merrill C.
